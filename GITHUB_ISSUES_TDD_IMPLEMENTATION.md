## 🚀 Phase 1: Core Foundation (6 Issues)

### Issue #1: Set up Vitest testing framework

**Title:** `feat(testing): [Phase 1] Set up Vitest testing framework`

**Description:**
This issue covers the setup and configuration of the Vitest testing framework for the Synapse project. This is a foundational step to enable Test-Driven Development (TDD) across the entire framework. We need to ensure Vitest is properly integrated into our monorepo structure and that our `make test` and `synapse test` commands are correctly configured to run the tests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Vitest is added as a dev dependency to the root `package.json`
- [ ] A `vitest.config.ts` file is created and configured at the project root to handle the monorepo workspace
- [ ] The `make test` command is updated to execute `vitest run`
- [ ] The `synapse test` command is implemented in the CLI to execute `vitest`
- [ ] A sample test file is created in `packages/core` to verify the setup
- [ ] The sample test runs successfully when `make test` is executed
- [ ] Documentation for running tests is updated in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] Test coverage reporting is configured with 95% threshold
- [ ] Watch mode is configured for development (`vitest --watch`)

**Test Cases:**
- **Command Verification:**
  - `make test` should trigger Vitest and run all tests in the monorepo
  - The `synapse test` command should be functional and produce the same output
- **Configuration Verification:**
  - The `vitest.config.ts` should correctly identify test files (e.g., `*.test.ts`)
- **Sample Test:**
  - A simple `add.test.ts` in `packages/core/src` should be created
  - The test must contain a basic assertion (e.g., `expect(1 + 1).toBe(2)`)
  - This test must be successfully executed by the test runner

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Install Vitest:** `npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui @vitest/coverage-v8`
2. **Create `vitest.config.ts`:** Create a root `vitest.config.ts` file configured for a monorepo
3. **Update `package.json`:** Add `"test": "vitest"` to the `scripts` section
4. **Update `Makefile`:** Modify the `test` target to run `npm test`
5. **Implement `synapse test` command:** Wire up the `synapse test` command in the `packages/cli` to execute Vitest
6. **Create Sample Test:** Add a simple test file in `packages/core/src` to confirm the setup works
7. **Update Documentation:** Add a "Running Tests" section to `CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Dependencies and Blockers:**
- **Dependencies:** None. This is a foundational task.
- **Blockers:** None.

**Labels:** `feature`, `testing`, `TDD`, `phase-1`, `setup`

**Milestone:** `TDD Implementation - Phase 1`

**Effort Estimate:** `Medium` (3-5 days)

- **Negative Tests:**
  - Test with invalid project names (e.g., `invalid/name`, empty string)
  - Test for file system errors (e.g., no write permissions)
  - Test with invalid template names

**Implementation Steps (TDD Cycle):**
1. **Write Failing Test (Integration):** In `packages/cli/src/commands/init.test.ts`, write a test that executes the `init` command and asserts that a new directory is created
2. **Implement Feature:** Create the basic `init` command logic in `packages/cli/src/commands/init.ts` to create the directory and a default `package.json`
3. **Run Tests:** Run `vitest` to see the test pass
4. **Refactor:** Refactor the implementation for clarity
5. **Repeat:** Continue this cycle for all other acceptance criteria

**Dependencies and Blockers:**
- **Dependencies:** Issue #1: Set up Vitest testing framework
- **Blockers:** The testing framework must be in place before work can begin

- [ ] Test results are reported in pull request comments
- [ ] Coverage reports are generated and stored as artifacts
- [ ] The pipeline supports multiple Node.js versions
- [ ] The pipeline supports both Linux and macOS environments

**Test Cases:**
- **CI Pipeline Tests:**
  - Test that the pipeline runs on every pull request
  - Test that the pipeline fails when coverage is below threshold
  - Test that the pipeline passes when all tests pass
  - Test that coverage reports are generated correctly
- **Quality Gate Tests:**
  - Test that PRs with low coverage are blocked
  - Test that PRs with failing tests are blocked
  - Test that PRs with passing tests and good coverage are allowed

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Create GitHub Actions workflow:** Set up `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
2. **Configure coverage reporting:** Integrate with Vitest coverage
3. **Set up quality gates:** Configure branch protection rules
4. **Test the pipeline:** Create test PRs to verify functionality
5. **Document the process:** Update CONTRIBUTING.md

**Dependencies and Blockers:**
- **Dependencies:** Issues #1-6: Core foundation must be complete
- **Blockers:** None

**Labels:** `feature`, `testing`, `TDD`, `phase-5`, `ci-cd`

**Milestone:** `TDD Implementation - Phase 5`

**Effort Estimate:** `Medium` (4-6 days)

### Issue #15: Test utilities and mocking framework

**Title:** `feat(testing): [Phase 5] Test utilities and mocking framework`

**Description:**
Create comprehensive test utilities and mocking framework to support TDD across all Synapse Framework components. This should include file system mocking, network mocking, and reusable test helpers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] File system mocking utilities are created and tested
- [ ] Network mocking utilities are created and tested
- [ ] Test data fixtures are created and organized
- [ ] Reusable test helpers are created and documented
- [ ] Mock factories for common objects are created
- [ ] Test environment setup utilities are created
- [ ] All utilities have comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Documentation for using utilities is created
- [ ] Utilities are integrated with the main test suite

**Test Cases:**
- **Utility Tests:**
  - Test file system mocking functions
  - Test network mocking functions
  - Test test data fixture loading
  - Test mock factory functions
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test utilities work with Vitest
  - Test utilities work with different test types
  - Test utilities are easy to use and understand

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Create test utilities directory:** Set up `packages/testing/src/utilities/`
2. **Implement file system mocking:** Create `mock-fs.ts`
3. **Implement network mocking:** Create `mock-network.ts`
4. **Create test fixtures:** Set up `fixtures/` directory
5. **Create mock factories:** Implement factory functions
6. **Write tests for utilities:** Ensure utilities are well-tested
7. **Document usage:** Create comprehensive documentation

**Dependencies and Blockers:**
- **Dependencies:** Issues #1-6: Core foundation must be complete
- **Blockers:** None

**Labels:** `feature`, `testing`, `TDD`, `phase-5`, `utilities`

**Milestone:** `TDD Implementation - Phase 5`

**Effort Estimate:** `Large` (8-12 days)

## 📊 Summary

**Total Issues:** 15  
**Total Effort:** 128-161 developer days  
**Timeline:** 8 months with 1 developer, 3-4 months with 3 developers  
**Success Metrics:**
- 100% test coverage for core commands
- 95% test coverage for feature commands
- All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Comprehensive documentation for all features

**Next Steps:**
1. Create these issues in GitHub
2. Assign to appropriate team members
3. Set up project board with phases
4. Begin implementation with Phase 1
5. Track progress and adjust timeline as needed

This comprehensive TDD implementation plan will ensure the Synapse Framework is robust, reliable, and maintainable for years to come.

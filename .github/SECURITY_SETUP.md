- ✅ Require review from code owners

#### Additional Rules
- ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ✅ Require linear history
- ✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
- ❌ Allow force pushes
- ❌ Allow deletions

### Develop Branch Protection
1. Add rule for `develop` branch

### Dependency Scanning
1. Ensure `.github/dependabot.yml` is present
2. Configure for all package managers:
   - npm (Node.js)
   - Cargo (Rust)
   - GitHub Actions

### Security Headers
1. Configure security headers in web applications
2. Set up security header validation in CI
3. Monitor security header compliance

## 5. Access Control

### Two-Factor Authentication
1. Require 2FA for all team members
2. Go to **Settings** → **Security** → **Two-factor authentication**
3. Enable "Require two-factor authentication for all members"

### SSH Key Management
1. Go to **Settings** → **SSH and GPG keys**
2. Configure SSH key restrictions
3. Set up GPG key signing for commits

### Personal Access Tokens
1. Go to **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens**
2. Configure fine-grained tokens with minimal permissions
3. Set expiration dates for all tokens

## 6. Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Alerts
1. Configure email notifications for:
   - Dependabot alerts
   - Code scanning alerts
   - Secret scanning alerts
   - Push protection alerts

### Integration Monitoring
1. Set up monitoring for:
   - Failed security scans
   - Bypassed protection rules
   - Unusual access patterns
   - Failed authentication attempts

## 7. Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Log
1. Go to **Settings** → **Audit log**
2. Monitor the following events:
   - Repository access changes
   - Branch protection rule changes
   - Team membership changes
   - Security setting modifications

### Compliance Reporting
1. Set up monthly security reports
2. Track security metrics:
   - Vulnerability resolution time
   - Security scan coverage
   - Branch protection effectiveness
   - Team access compliance

## 8. Incident Response

### Security Incident Workflow
1. Create security incident template
2. Set up escalation procedures
3. Configure emergency access procedures
4. Document response times and procedures

### Communication Channels
1. Set up security notification channels:
   - Email: security@synapse-framework.dev
   - Slack: #security-alerts
   - Discord: #security channel

## 9. Documentation and Training
